# Scientific-Calculator
The objective of this project was to create a scientific calculator where the user can push buttons like a normal numeric keypad and perform basic mathematical calculations, and display those results in text form.
The user can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power function, logarithm, sin, cosine, tan and square root function.
The user can use features like backspace, clear, pi and e constants.
This system implements flow layout and uses encapsulation to hide the data members and modularity to differentiate main class, GUI class and the class that implements all the calculation after the user presses the "=" button.
